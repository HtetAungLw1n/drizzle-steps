# 🪜 Steps

Steps is a full-stack CRUD application built with **Next.js** and **PostgreSQL**, designed to manage and track... well, anything that requires steps 😄 (tasks, goals, projects). It's a simple but powerful demo of modern web development with server-side rendering, API routes, and database integration.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to structure the folder and file.
- How server-side rendering works in Next.js
- Connecting and querying a PostgreSQL database
- Setting up environment variables for DB connections

## 🧠 Problems & How I Solved Them

- I missed a column in the database when writing the schema, so I had to update it and re-run the migration. Minor setback, but a good reminder to double-check the schema before committing.
- I wasn't familiar with Drizzle's new syntax at first, so I had to keep jumping back to the docs. It was a bit of a learning curve, but now I feel way more confident writing it on my own.
