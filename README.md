# 🪜 Steps

Steps is a full-stack CRUD application built with **Next.js** and **PostgreSQL**, designed to manage and track... well, anything that requires steps 😄 (tasks, goals, projects). It's a simple but powerful demo of modern web development with server-side rendering, API routes, and database integration.
